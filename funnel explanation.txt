get the portals (lines that connect the triangles)

List<left points>
List<right points>

edge normal = triangle[i+1]->position - triangle[i]->position


each portal has two points
  add the portal on the left of the edge normal to the left points
  add the portal on the right of the edge normal to the right points
  
routine

STEP 1 -> keep incrementing the blue and orange points until one breaches the funnel
	  the breach point is one part of the funnel

	  the breach point is a neccessary point in the path

STEP 2 -> iterate through the other set until it crosses the other (old) funnel edge
	  this point is the second new funnel point

repeat steps until both sets reach the end point
